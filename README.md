Midterm Practice App

The Main activity of the app is buttons that direct to other apps. These buttons all use the XML onclick tag, but the apps inside use the onClickListener. If you want to add an activity to the app, first add a button to the main activity and then direct it to your activity. That way no ones code should interfere with each other.
